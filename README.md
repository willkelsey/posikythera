# Antikythera Simulation

## Software Design Process Model

The ideal software process model for this project is the incremental development model. This model is an efficient choice because a small set of the software can be built, and then will be expanded upon with each iteration of development. There will also be a small amount of integrate and configure regarding planetary motion. Equations and methods on 2-D planet modeling already exist, so these will be used and implemented to satisfy the requirements of the software. 
Specifications: Specifications will include the mass of the planet, the diameter of the planet, the centripetal velocity, rotations in a day, distance between the planets. More can be added between the initial versions and the intermediate versions.

Development: The first version of the program will be to model the solar systemâ€™s behavior with only the earth and the sun. Obviously, this is not the final version of the program as, ideally, more planets and events will be in the program. As the program moves towards a smoother model of the sun and the earth, more elements can be added into the program without complications. If the 2-D version is flawless, the 3-D version can be put into production.

Validation: The system can then be tested at a higher level to see if the program is accurate. All the data should make sense and the program should seem correct to the user. For example, a year would be much longer for a planet further away from the sun. Also, events, such as solar eclipses, should happen every so often.
